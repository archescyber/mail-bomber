# Mail Bomber

## Description

This project is a Python-based tool designed for sending mass emails. It allows users to send emails quickly and efficiently while providing features to prevent spam filters from blocking the messages.

## Features

- Sends bulk emails to a list of recipients.
- Allows users to utilize multiple email addresses to minimize the risk of being flagged as spam.
- Configurable settings to customize the email content and delivery options.
- Provides an option to read the `mail.txt`  file, which contains email addresses and their corresponding SMTP keys.
  
## Important Note

Users must ensure that they read and understand the `mail.txt` file format before running the program. This file is essential for the tool to function properly.

## How to get SMTP key?

**• Enable Two-Step Verification:** Activate two-step verification on your Google account.


**• Create an App Password:** Type "app password" in the search bar of your Google account to access the password creation section.


**• Generate SMTP Password:** Create an app password named "SMTP" in the password creation section and copy it.


**• SMTP Password Ready:** Your SMTP password is now ready to be used with the software.


### mail.txt File Format

The `mail.txt`  file should be formatted as follows:

- Each line should contain an entry in the format:  `email:smtp_key`
  
**Example:**
```
example1@example.com:smtp_key_1 
example2@example.com:smtp_key_2 
example3@example.com:smtp_key_3
```
Make sure there are no extra spaces before or after the entries. Each email and SMTP key pair must be on its own line.
